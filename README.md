# PYTHON Portfolio as a biotechnology engineer
Welcome to my portfolio and thanks for your consideration by reading it 

I learned how to program by self-learning Python and SQL, as my background is more related towards engineering and biotechnology. I believe that Python is a powerful tool but I found it really useful for me to apply it into computational biology and data science. I have a solid understanding of Python but I'm still doing an effort 

With this portfolo I want to show my abilities of ETL, exploratory analysis, data visualization, machine learning and statistics. I will be using basic libraries such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, and scikitlearn. I have included 3 projects which will help to showcase my abilities

I am also proud to say that I have strong critical-thinking and problem-solving skills even though I can recognize that my programming skills can be improven. With this being said I believe to be an ideal candidate for the Bioengineering program at KAUST as I am motivated into programming and biology.

# WebMD drugs user experience
My first project consists of a WebMD reviews dataset in which consisted of 300k entries of drugs with a score related to satisfaction, effectiveness and ease of use. My goal was to visualize how does Condition feature relates towards the given scores and see which of them have a better reception and effect on the user

# Novozyme stability

# Exploratory analysis
# Generating conclusions
# Dashboard with the info
# ML program 

My next goals are to being able to properply scrape relevant data, and use more powerful algorithms to make predicitions and models.

Thanks a lot for taking the time to read throughout my portfolio, and hope we can reach any time soon.
